Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane. Each segment is
represented as a pair of points: a starting point and an ending point. Define a constructor
make-segment and selectors start-segment and end-segment that define the representation
of segments in terms of points. Furthermore, a point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the x
coordinate and the y coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and selectors
x-point and y-point that define this representation. Finally, using your selectors and
constructors, define a procedure midpoint-segment that takes a line segment as argument and
returns its midpoint (the point whose coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints).
To try your procedures, youâ€™ll need a way to print points: |#

(define (make-segment start end)
               (cons start end))

(define (start-segment segment)
                 (car segment))

(define (end-segment segment)
               (cdr segment))

(define (make-point x y)
             (cons x y))

(define (x-point point)
           (car point))

(define (y-point point)
           (cdr point))

(define (midpoint-segment seg)
  (define (average a b) (/ (+ a b) 2))
  (let ((start (start-segment seg))
        (end (end-segment seg)))
    (make-point (average (x-point start)
                         (x-point end))
                (average (y-point start)
                         (y-point end)))))

(define (print-point p)
 (newline)
 (display "(")
 (display (x-point p))
 (display ",")
 (display (y-point p))
 (display ")"))

(define test-seg
  (make-segment (make-point 1 10)
                (make-point 5 15)))
