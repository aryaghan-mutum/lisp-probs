# ML-Programming-Solutions

This repository has the solutions for 1-9 chapters. [The Elements of ML Programming](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/emlp.html) is a book on functional programming. The book uses **Standard ML (SML)** programming language which is one of the dialects of [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language))

**Meta Language (ML)** may not be as popular compared to Clojure or Java in regard to developing applications. However, ML is known for solving theorem proving and compiler writing. In the beginning years of ML it used interpreter. Since interpreter is tend to be slower than compiler with regard to execution speed. Today ML uses compiler. 

ML is a strongly typed, modular, geenral purpose, functional programming language.

It uses type inference and has type declarations. In ML, expressions are determined in compiled time. Some of the popular Meta Languages are: Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ) and OCaml.

In this book, the solutions were programmed using [SML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML)

ML supports:
- Higher-Order Functions
- Recursions
- Polymorphism
- Functors 
- Strong types

ML doesn't support:
- Side-effects (no mutation)
